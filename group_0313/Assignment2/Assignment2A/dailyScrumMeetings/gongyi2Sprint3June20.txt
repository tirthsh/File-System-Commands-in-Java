a) What did I work on last time?
- Tested Directory class
- Tested File class
- Continued to improve code and make corrections
b) What do I plan to work on now?
- Code fileSystem class (As opposed to original design of no specific system class)
- Code stack class and methods
c) Am I blocked on anything?
- Need to decide what methods to write for fileSystem class, should I make it more comprehensive? or should I leave some specific tasks to some of the command classes?
