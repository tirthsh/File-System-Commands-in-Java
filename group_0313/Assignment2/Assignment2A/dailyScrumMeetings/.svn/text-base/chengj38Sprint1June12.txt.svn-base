a) What did I work on last time?
	- Designing the fileSystem class
	- Writing test cases for the fileSystem class
	- researching JTrees as potential implementation for the fileSystem
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?
	- finalize test cases for the fileSystem class
	- finish the fileSystem class
	- potentially work on other classes related to the fileSystem

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- Understanding JTrees for the fileSystem class
	- pondering other possible design structures to implement the filesystem
