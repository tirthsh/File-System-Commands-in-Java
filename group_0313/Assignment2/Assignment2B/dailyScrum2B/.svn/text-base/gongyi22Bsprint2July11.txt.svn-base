what did I work on last time?
- Completed mv class
- made changes to existing fileSystem code

What do I plan on working now?
- Finish cp class
- clean up mv, cp, ls class, all filesystem classes. ie. add comments and java doc, fix spacing and naming convention.
- start grep command.

Am I stuck on anything?
Pokemon Go is taking too much time :)
